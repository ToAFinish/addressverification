      PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS TRIGGER HAS BEEN REPLACED WITH THE "autoVerifyOfficeAddress" ONE

      THIS TRIGGER RESETS THE "VERIFIED" FLAG ON THE ADDRESS(ES)
      SO THAT WHEN THE "VERIFY ADDRESSES" BUTTON IS PRESSED IN 
      THE RECORD LAYOUT, THE SYSTEM WILL ACTUALLY ATTEMPT TO 
      VERIFY IT.  WE DO THIS TO CONSERVE API CALLS.  IF THE 
      ADDRESS WAS PREVIOUSLY VERIFIED AND HAS NOT CHANGED, WHY
      ATTEMPT TO VERIFY IT AGAIN?
